# Developer Hangout Coding Challenge
## May 2018 - e-commerce backend

*Daniel Duarte*
*List of external files used (Libraries, Frameworks): Adonisjs Angular*

*List of all endpoints along with a brief description on each endpoint and how it is used. This is a very crucial part of the challenge, and is required to be here in the README. Failure to document the endpoints will result in a DQ*

*A brief description of the entire App, including features and how you handled organizing/tracking the data. This is also a good place to reference any issues you had or your general experience*
